1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

  1. A transaction/group of transactions is/are requested/created
  2. A block for the transaction(s) is created and includes the hash of the previous block
  3. The block is sent to all of the nodes in the network
  4. Those nodes validate the transaction(s)/block through completing a proof of work
  5. Successful miners are awarded 
  6. Block is added/transaction(s) complete

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

  - To mine a coin, miners must solve an arbitrarily complex computational math problem, also called a "proof of work." To complete a proof of work, miners must find the proof that, when hashed, matches a target hash.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

  - Cellular Automata have many potential uses in surprisingly diverse fields: digital media artists can use them to generate visual or acoustic patterns in their works; cellular automata can also serve as pseudorandom number generators to be used by cryptographers; they can, at least theoretically, be used to implement future designs of computer processors; and they can be used to model and study various biological and physical systems and processes.
